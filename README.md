## Overview

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health conditions worldwide. Traditional diagnosis relies heavily on self-reported surveys, which depressed individuals often resist completing. This project proposes a **big data analytics framework** for detecting depression risk at the user level using social network data — without relying on self-reports.

The framework has three core components:

1. **ML Classification** — Seven machine learning models trained on Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits extracted from Facebook status updates to classify users by depression risk
2. **Intention Modeling** — An NLP pipeline using TF-IDF vectorization to classify the speech acts (assertive, directive, expressive) behind user status updates, capturing the *intent* driving social media behavior
3. **Social Influence Modeling** — A graph-based network model using shortest-path algorithms to quantify how depression risk propagates through a user's friendship network

## Dataset

**MyPersonality Dataset** — A real-world Facebook dataset containing:
- Status updates from ~250 users
- Big Five personality trait scores (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- Depression labels derived from validated psychometric assessments
- Social network connections between users

> The MyPersonality dataset is a restricted academic dataset and is not included in this repository. To request access, visit the [MyPersonality Project](http://mypersonality.org/).

An AI-generated speech act dataset is included for the intention modeling component.

## Results

### Model Comparison — Depression Risk Classification

All models were trained on Big Five OCEAN trait features with an 80/20 train-test split and evaluated using Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1 Score.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Precision | Recall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SVM** ✅ | **74.1%** | **85.1%** | 74.9% | 98.3% |
| Neural Network | 73.5% | 84.6% | 76.3% | 94.9% |
| Random Forest | 70.7% | 82.3% | 75.4% | 90.5% |
| KNN | 69.5% | 81.5% | 74.9% | 89.3% |
| Logistic Regression | 68.8% | 81.0% | 74.6% | 88.6% |
| Naive Bayes | 64.4% | 77.3% | 74.3% | 80.5% |
| CART (Decision Tree) | 59.6% | 71.8% | 75.7% | 68.2% |

**SVM achieved the best overall performance** with 74.1% accuracy and 85.1% F1 score — selected as the final model for deployment.

### Intention Model — Speech Act Classification
- Classified user status updates into speech acts: **assertive, directive, expressive, commissive**
- Used TF-IDF vectorization + Random Forest and SVM classifiers
- 80% training / 20% test split with 10-fold cross-validation on training set

### Social Influence Model — Network Graph
- Built a directed friendship network of 250 users using **NetworkX**
- Applied **shortest-path algorithms** to compute influence propagation scores
- Quantified how a user's depression risk is affected by their connections' mental states
- Visualized influence scores and network topology in Tableau

## Key Findings

- **Personality traits alone are meaningful predictors of depression risk** — SVM achieved 74.1% accuracy using only Big Five OCEAN scores as features
- **High recall (98.3% for SVM) is critical** in mental health contexts — it is preferable to flag more users for review than to miss at-risk individuals
- **Social influence propagates depression risk** — users with 2-3 degrees of connection to depressed users showed measurably higher influence scores in the network model
- **Speech act patterns differ** between depressed and non-depressed users — depressed users showed higher rates of expressive and directive speech acts
